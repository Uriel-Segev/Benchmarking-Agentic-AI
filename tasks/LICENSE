Original authors are credited in each task's task.yaml file.

Modified files:
  - pytorch-model-recovery/tests/test_outputs.py
      Changed ground-truth weights path from /tests/weights_gtruth.pt
      to /app/tests/weights_gtruth.pt to match VM filesystem layout
      (original used a Docker bind-mount at /tests/).
  - pytorch-model-recovery/solution.sh
      Changed `python` to `python3` and updated torch.load() calls to use
      weights_only=True; added absolute paths for clarity.
  - hf-model-inference/task.yaml
      Updated instruction to reflect that the model is pre-cached during
      rootfs prep rather than downloaded at runtime.
  - hf-model-inference/solution.sh
      Removed runtime model download; loads from pre-cached local path
      /app/model_cache/sentiment_model instead.
